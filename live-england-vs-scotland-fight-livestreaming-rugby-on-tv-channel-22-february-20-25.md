England vs Scotland LIVE: Updates from Six Nations ahead of fascinating Calcutta Cup clash

England will be out for a rare Calcutta Cup success as Scotland take on the Auld Enemy in a crunch Six Nations clash.

Guinness Men's Six Nations: England v Scotland

Venue: Allianz Stadium, Twickenham Date: Saturday, 22 February Kick-off: 16:45 GMT

Coverage: Listen live on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio Scotland & BBC Sounds; text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app; watch on ITV1

One week in rugby is a long time.

When a dejected England walked off the pitch in Dublin, it looked like a Six Nations title was a long way off.

A star-studded France had just put 43 unanswered points on Wales and were next up. Another loss and a title shot was all but over.

But one week was enough time to put those wrongs right as England delivered at the death to defeat Les Bleus and lift the pressure valve on head coach Steve Borthwick.

Meanwhile, following a bonus-point win over Italy in their opening game, Gregor Townsend's Scotland started their championship off with a handy five points.
